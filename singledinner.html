      <div class="section-title">About Chapathi Koorma</div>
      <p>Chapathi Koorma is a classic Indian dish combining soft and fluffy chapathis with a rich and flavorful koorma,
        a mildly spiced curry made with vegetables or meat. It is a perfect meal for lunch or dinner, offering a
        satisfying and healthy combination of textures and flavors.</p>

    <div class="cooking-type">
      <div class="section-title">Cooking Type</div>
      <p>The chapathis are prepared by rolling whole wheat dough into thin flatbreads and cooking them on a tawa
        (griddle) with minimal oil. The koorma is made by slow-cooking a mixture of vegetables or meat with aromatic
        spices and a creamy base, typically made from coconut, yogurt, or cashew paste.</p>

    <div class="history">
      <div class="section-title">A Small History</div>
      <p>Chapathi Koorma has its roots in traditional Indian cuisine, particularly from the southern regions of India.
        While chapathis are a staple across the country, koorma has historically been a royal dish, known for its rich
        flavor and creamy texture. Over time, this combination became popular in many Indian households.</p>
